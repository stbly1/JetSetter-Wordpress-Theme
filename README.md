JetSetter-Wordpress-Theme  v 0.9
=========================

Travel-themed Wordpress template originally used to create the website www.ashlanddispatch.com; disambiguation for broader use in progress

Version Notes:

  * Current version is specifically designed to be used with original intent; still working on flexibiliy
  * Custom header support not implemented; in progress
  * Blog-style homepage option not yet implemented; in progress
  * Support for "normal" blog posts (i.e., not travel related, but simple updates or notes) not yet implemented; in progress

Theme Usage Notes:

  * Home page, footers and certain sidebars will automatically display links to all other blog pages
  * Main blog posts should use the "Destinations" custom post-type. This post type allows the use of four different image layouts. Use the keywords below in the "class" field in Wordpress's image editor to apply the respective stylings:
      * 'single' - image will display full-page width and, on non-mobile browsers, will have the same height as the browser window
      * 'double' - images tagged with this will be grouped in twos; the group will be full-page width and be approximately half the browser's height
      * 'triple' - images tagged with this will be grouped in threes; the group will be full-page width and be approximately one third the browser's height
      * 'featured' - image will dispaly full-page width, be the height of the browser's window, and will stay static within it's window as the user scrolls, giving the impression that the image is in the background of the post
  * 'Regions' Taxonomy - this custom taxonomy is available as a means for grouping destinations as a navigation tool; all regions show up on the home page and in certain sidebars
